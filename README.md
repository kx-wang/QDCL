# QDCL

This code calculates the wavefunctions and simulates for the transport properties in THz 
Quantum Dot Cascade Lasers (QDCLs). The effects of longitudinal-optical (LO) phonons and longitudinal-acoustic (LA) phonons on the transport are included. The transport model used is a time-local density matrix model, within the second-order Born-Markov approximation, also known as the Interaction approach or Redfield equations.
